    dormitory_description: The dormitory Kajetánka has two buldings, K1 and K2. <br/> The building Kajetánka I (or K1) consists of two buildings, each one having fifteen floors. The rooms at K1 are both single and double (for one person and two persons) and are organized in "cells". Each cell has a single room, a double room, a bathroom and, a toilet. Each cell contains a fridge. On each floor, there are eight cells and a shared kitchen with two stoves, an oven, and a microwave. Both K1 buildings are interconnected through a low-rise building where a canteen ("menza") can be found and which is open during lunchtime on working days. The advantages of K1 are being close to bus stops and the canteen, having ovens and microwaves in the kitchens and a great view from the higher floors. The disadvantages are smaller rooms, some noise from a street nearby and noisy student events taking place in the shared kitchens. If you live on a higher floor, you spend a lot of time waiting for an elevator. <br/> The building Kajetánka II (K2) has the shape of the letter "U" and it has six floors. The rooms at K2 are double only and each cell consists of two rooms. Each cell has its own bathroom and toilet, each room at K2 has its own kitchenette with a fridge and a hotplate. Since it is further from the road and there are no rooms for parties, K2 is calmer than K1. Also, the rooms are larger and they all have a kitchenette, although it contains only the hotplate. The people at K2 also like a bit more personal and friendlier atmosphere. K2 also has a gym and a music room. However, the distance to the bus stops is larger. The walls between the two rooms in a cell is thin and does not isolate noise well. <br/> In both buildings, there are study rooms (K2 has them on all floors), a TV room, a laundry room, and a drying room. At K1 only, you find administration offices, a billiard table and a common/party room with a piano. At K2 only, you find the gym, a table-tennis room, and the music room with a piano. At receptions of both buildings you can buy sandwich baguettes for discounted prices, there are also snack vending machines and printing machines.<br/> Concrete room description is written on <a href="http://www.kajka.koleje.cuni.cz/en/room-state/">our web page</a>.
